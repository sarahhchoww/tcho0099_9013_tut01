# Week 8 Design Research for major assignment

## HEADING 2

### HEADING 3
## Part 1
The idea for the major project is inspired by the work of Chuck Chase. In Image 1, the artwork is divided into grids. Each cell captures its corresponding colour of the original artwork. In video 2, random cats appear across the grids. With reference to these two pieces of artwork, I plan to make the cats move along the gridlines. The cat will disappear when the user clicks on it, and reappear at a random cell. It will be a simulation of a "hide and seek" game between the user and the cat.
